 ### :raising_hand_woman: About me: 
 Ambitious ‚ù§Ô∏è Self-Motivated ‚ù§Ô∏è Fast learner ‚ù§Ô∏è Detail-oriented
 
  
I wanted to find a more interesting job and learn something new, so I decided to change my career path. At the beginning of 2022, I started an 8-month mentoring program focused on Javascript & React. After finishing it, I am still learning and strengthening my skills in this field by creating smaller and larger projects. In addition, I have gained ability in creating  UI Designs using Figma, as it is important to me that my frontend projects are visually appealing as well.
I am open to new technologies and am actively seeking my first job as a Junior **Front-End Developer** :blush:

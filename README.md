 ### 🙋‍♀️ About me: 
 Ambitious ❤️ Self-Motivated ❤️ Fast learner ❤️ Detail-oriented
 
  
I wanted to find a more interesting job and learn something new, so I decided to change my career path. At the beginning of 2022, I started an 8-month mentoring program focused on Javascript & React. After finishing it, I am still learning and strengthening my skills in this field by creating smaller and larger projects. In addition, I have gained ability in creating  UI Designs using Figma, as it is important to me that my frontend projects are visually appealing as well.
📖 In October, I started postgraduate studies in Web Application Programming at AGH, allowing me to expand my knowledge not only in frontend but also in backend languages and databases.
